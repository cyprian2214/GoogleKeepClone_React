# Google Keep Clone - React

This is a React (Vite) version of the uploaded Google Keep Clone (originally vanilla JS + HTML).

How to run:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Build: `npm run build`

Notes:
- Data is stored in `localStorage`.
- This project is intentionally minimal and focused on converting the original functionality into React components.
